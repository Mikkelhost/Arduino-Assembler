# Arduino-Assembler
Reads a specified .txt file from a SD card and assembles it to binary machine language for a PLC my group and i made with an FPGA on my 4th semester.

To be more specific, you connect a micro SD to a SD reader which was bought of ebay. It reads the .txt file which we specified in the console
then it turns the txt into binary code. This binary code is something that we have defined from the buttom. I will not go into furthor details on how this works.
Feel free to contact me if you got any question regarding this project. Here is an example of what the text in a file would get translated to.
It is in danish but it basically just shows the text file vs how it looks after being written to an EEPROM.
